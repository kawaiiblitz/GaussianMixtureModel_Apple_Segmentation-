# Gaussian Mixture Model for Apple Segmentation

This notebook extends our exploration of fitting parametric models to visual data, with a focus on real-world applications.     

The primary objective of this part is to apply Gaussian mixture models to distinguish between apple and non-apple pixels in images. We will utilize the RGB color space as our feature dimensions.Additionally, we will test our model's performance on new data, quantify the results using ROC curves, and explore the implications of using separate data sets for training, validation, and testing to ensure our model's robustness and generalizability.
